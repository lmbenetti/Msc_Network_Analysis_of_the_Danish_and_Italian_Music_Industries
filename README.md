This repository contains the database created for the paper "Network Analysis of the Danish and Italian Music Industries" by Daniel Fejerskov-Quist and Lisandro Marco Benetti (2025).
It includes a bipartite and projected network of the Danish music industry, as well as a combined network where the Danish data is merged with the Italian music network presented in Node Attribute Analysis for Cultural Data Analytics: A Case Study on Italian XX–XXI Century Music by Michele Coscia (2024).

Coscia’s original dataset can be downloaded from: https://www.michelecoscia.com/ and is also included in this repository.

In the `code` folder, you will find the scripts used to reproduce the figures. The code relies on Michele Coscia’s `torch_nvd` library.

IMPORTANT NOTE: The database was further cleaned and modified after the paper was submitted, so there may be some differences compared to the results shown in the paper.
Some files contain code written by Michele Coscia that was adapted by DF-Q and LMB. 

Figures 9, 10 and 19 were done using Cytoscape. The `.cys` can be found in the `code` folder.
Tables 3, 4 and 8 were done manually, using data from Cytoscape.
