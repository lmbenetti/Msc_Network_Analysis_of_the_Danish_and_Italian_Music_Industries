# Msc_Network_Analysis_of_the_Danish_and_Italian_Music_Industries
This repository contains the database created for the paper "Network Analysis of the Danish and Italian Music Industries" by Daniel Fejerskov-Quist and Lisandro Marco Benetti (2025).
It includes a bipartite and projected network of the Danish music industry, as well as a combined network where the Danish data is merged with the Italian music network presented in Node Attribute Analysis for Cultural Data Analytics: A Case Study on Italian XX–XXI Century Music by Michele Coscia (2024).
Coscia’s original dataset can be downloaded from: https://www.michelecoscia.com/

In the code folder, you will find the scripts used to reproduce the figures. The code relies on Michele Coscia’s torch_nvd library.
Some files contain code written by Michele Coscia that was adapted by DF-Q and LMB. 

Some files include code originally written by Coscia, which was adapted by DF-Q and LMB.

The database was further cleaned after the paper was submitted, so there may be minor, non-substantial differences compared to the results shown in the paper.
